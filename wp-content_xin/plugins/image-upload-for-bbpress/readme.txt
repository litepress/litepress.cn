Upload inline images to BBPress forum topics and replies.

== Description ==

This plugin enables the TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor for BBPress forum topics and replies and adds a button to the editor's "Insert/edit image" dialog that allows forum users to upload images from their computer and insert them inline into their posts.

A [pro version](https://aspengrovestudios.com/product/image-upload-for-bbpress-pro/?utm_source=image-upload-for-bbpress&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wp-repo-upgrade-link) with the following additional features is also available:

* Change the directory where uploaded images are stored.
* Limit which user roles are permitted to upload images.
* Limit the number of uploaded images allowed per post.
* Automatically downsize images to fit specified maximum dimensions.
* Convert all uploaded images to the same image format, if desired.
* Set PNG and JPEG compression levels so images take up less disk space.
* Allow users to view enlarged images in a lightbox by clicking on them within the post.
* View total image count and file size statistics.
* Use [Amazon S3â„¢](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to store and serve uploaded images in submitted forum posts (optional; requires [add-on plugin](https://aspengrovestudios.com/product/image-upload-for-bbpress-pro/?utm_source=image-upload-for-bbpress&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wp-repo-upgrade-link) purchase).
