Simple Feature Requests is a user feedback and idea management tool for WordPress.

== Description ==

Keeping a list of all the feature requests you get from your users can be a cumbersome task. Maybe you're managing your customer feedback all via spreadsheet and adding "+1"s to requests? Perhaps you're using an expensive third party solution?

Whatever method you use, chances are it costs you time *AND* money.

**Simple Feature Requests** aims to make the whole process of collecting customer feedback and idea management *much* easier for you. Now you can let your users submit requests themselves and vote on the ones they want to see in your product --- all from within your existing WordPress website.

= Simple Feature Requests Free =

The free version of the plugin provides the following features:

* Accept user-submitted feature requests.
* Users can vote on features they want to see included in your product.
* Users can comment on feature requests using the native WordPress commenting system.
* Admins can approve and manage feature requests.
* Intelligent search before submitting user feedback.
* Sort/filter by "Latest", "Top", "My Requests", and "Status".
* Select status from "Pending", "Published", "Under Review", "Complete", "Started", "Planned", and "Declined".
* Ability to add custom statuses (requires code snippet).

= Simple Feature Requests Pro =

= Pro Feature Highlight: Product Roadmap =

Simple Feature Requests makes it easy to create a comprehensive product roadmap based on the customer feedback you've received.

Our roadmap shortcode presents your product's requests in a kanban view, organized by request status.

You can configure which status columns to display in the roadmap and use the shortcode multiple times throughout your website.

A product roadmap is essential for any product-based business. It allows you to keep your users in the loop about upcoming features and when to expect them.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a Pro version of the plugin? =

Yes, there is! You can get it from our [website](https://simplefeaturerequests.com/?utm_source=JCK&utm_medium=wp.org&utm_campaign=Readme).

= What is a feature request system? =

A feature request system, also known as a user feedback board or idea management board, allows your customers to submit features without someone having to manually manage them and reply every time one is submitted; thus freeing up your time to grow your product.

Gathering customer feedback in this way will enable you to prioritise which features are important to your customers, and which features will be the most profitable for your company.

= Will users have to submit feature requests via my WordPress admin? =

No! Users submit feature requests through the front-end of your website. They never have to know you’re using WordPress if you don’t want them to.

= Can I categorize feature requests? =

Yes, with the [Pro version](https://simplefeaturerequests.com/?utm_source=JCK&utm_medium=wp.org&utm_campaign=Readme).

= I'm getting a 404 error when loading a request or the requests archive. =

You may need to refresh your permalinks. Go to Settings > Permalinks. Just visiting that settings page will refresh the permalinks.
