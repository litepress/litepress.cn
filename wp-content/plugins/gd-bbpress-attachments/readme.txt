* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where can I configure the plugin? =
Open the Forums menu, and you will see Attachments item there. This will open a panel with global plugin settings.

= Why is Media Library required? =
All attachments uploads are handled by the WordPress Media Library, and plugin uses native WordPress upload functions. When the file is uploaded it will be available through Media Library. Consult WordPress documentation about Media Library requirements.

= Will this plugin work with standalone bbPress installation? =
No. This plugin requires the plugin versions of bbPress 2.6.2 or higher.

= Does this plugin work with bbPress and BuddyPress groups? =
GD bbPress Attachments 4.2 is tested with BuddyPress 6.0 using bbPress for Groups forums. Make sure you enable JavaScript and CSS Settings Always Include option in the plugin settings.

= What are the common problems that can prevent upload to work? =
In some cases, it can happen that jQuery is not included on the page, even so, the bbPress requires it to be loaded. That can happen if something else is unloading jQuery. If the jQuery is not present, the upload will not work.
Another common issue is that WordPress Media Library upload is not working. If that is not set up, attachments upload can't work.
