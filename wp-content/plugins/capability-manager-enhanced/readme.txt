PublishPress Capabilities is the best plugin to customize your permissions and user roles. You can control who has access to your WordPress site. 

== Description ==

[PublishPress Capabilities](https://publishpress.com/capabilities/) gives you control over all the permissions on your WordPress site. We built this user role editor plugin so you have an EASY and POWERFUL way to manage users.

You can customize all the user roles on your site, from Administrators and Editors to Authors, Contributors, Subscribers and custom roles. Each role can have the exact permissions that your site needs.

PublishPress Capabilities is SAFE TO USE. Every time you change your site's permissions, PublishPress Capabilities will take a backup that you can restore if anything goes wrong. You can use these backups to migrate your roles and permissions from one site to another.

= The 10 Key Features of PublishPress Capabilities =

- **Edit user roles**: You can change the capabilities for any role.
- **Works for all post types**: Choose who can Publish, Read, Edit and Delete content for any post type.
- **Works for all taxonomies**: Choose who can Manage, Edit and Assign terms in any taxonomy.
- **Safe backups**: Every time you change your permissions, PublishPress Capabilities saves a backup.
- **Create or copy user roles**: Add new roles, or clone existing roles.
- **Frontend menus (Pro version)**: Stop users from accessing any frontend menu link.
- **Admin menus (Pro version)**: Stop users from accessing any admin menu link.
- **Media library permissions**: Decide who can upload, edit and delete files.
- **WooCommerce permissions**: Control access to WooCommerce products, orders, coupons and more.
- **Multisite support**: Manage permissions on a single site or across your whole network.

= Control User Permissions =

PublishPress Capabilities gives you detailed control over all the permissions on your WordPress site. You can customize all the user roles on your site, from Administrator to Subscriber. 

With Capabilities, you can choose who can Publish, Read, Edit and Delete content. You can choose permissions for posts, pages, custom content types, categories, tags, and more.

= Capabilities for any Post Type =

Many WordPress users have sites with custom post types. This can be done using custom code, a theme, or with a plugin. No matter how your post type is created, PublishPress Capabilities lets you enforce and assign distinct capabilities for your post type.

= Capabilities for any Taxonomy =

The PublishPress Capabilities plugin allows you to add extra permissions to the taxonomies on your site. This feature includes the default Categories and Tags, but also applies to other taxonomies. For example, in WooCommerce you can apply custom permissions to Product categories, Product tags, and Product shipping classes. You can enforce and assign "Manage", "Edit" and "Assign" distinct capabilities for all your taxonomies.

= Backup and Restore Roles and Capabilities =

PublishPress Capabilities offers you the ability to back up and restore your permissions. This feature is very helpful if you want to test out changes on your site, or if you've installed a new plugin that has changed your site's permissions.

Every time you change your permissions, the PublishPress Capabilities plugin will now automatically create a backup. If you make a mistake, go to the "Backup" menu link and you'll be able to roll back to a previous version.

= Create or Copy User Roles = 

With PublishPress Capabilities you can create or copy any existing WordPress user role. These roles can be customized in exactly the same way as the default WordPress roles. These new roles can be added to single sites or to an entire multisite network.

[Click here to see how to create or copy user roles](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/create-or-copy-user-roles/).

= Frontend Menu Restrictions (Pro version) =

PublishPress Capabilities enables you to restrict access to navigation menus by roles, logged in and logged out users. This is useful because a default WordPress site does not give you way to control the visibility of your links.

= Admin Menu Restrictions (Pro version) =

With PublishPress Capabilities you can restrict access to admin menu screens by user roles. This is useful because many plugin do not have any way to control who can access their admin screens.

[Click to see how to block Admin menu access](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/admin-menus/).

= Support for Media Library Permissions =

PublishPress Capabilities enables you to decide who can upload, edit and delete files from your site's Media Library. By default, only Administrators are able to delete files in your Media Library. Subscribers and Contributors are not even allowed to upload files. You can customize these permissions for the Media Library and also the Featured Image box.

[Click here to learn about Media Library permissions](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/control-media-library-access/).

= Support for WooCommerce Permissions =

We mentioned earlier that PublishPress Capabilities has special support for WooCommerce taxonomies. This is true for the rest of WooCommerce also. With PublishPress Capabilities you can control permissions for WooCommerce products, orders and coupons.

[Click here to learn about WooCommerce permissions](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/woocommerce-permissons/).

= WordPress Multisite support =

PublishPress Capabilities allows you to control permissions on a single site or across your whole network. Every time you update permissions in PublishPress Capabilities, you can choose to sync those changes across your multisite network.

= Permissions for Custom Statuses =

This option will appear if you have the [PublishPress](https://publishpress.com/publishpress) plugin installed to create and configure custom statuses. With Capabilities Pro, you can decide which user roles are able to send posts to each status.  For status-specific editing control, also activate [PublishPress Permissions Pro](https://publishpress.com/presspermit) and its Status Control module.
