A passenger plane has crashed shortly after take-off from Kyrgyzstan's
capital, Bishkek, killing a large number of those on board. The head of
Kyrgyzstan's civil aviation authority said that out of about 90
passengers and crew, only about 20 people have survived. The Itek Air
Boeing 737 took off bound for Mashhad, in north-eastern Iran, but turned
round some 10 minutes later.
