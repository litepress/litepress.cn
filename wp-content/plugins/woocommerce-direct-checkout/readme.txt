== Formerly WooCommerce Direct Checkout ==

This plugin was formerly known as "WooCommerce Direct Checkout". WordPress forced us on August 8, 2019 to change the name of the plugin due to use of the "WooCommerce" word at the beginning of the name. We apologize for the problems that the downtime may have caused to you.

== Ajax add to cart ==

The Ajax add to cart option allows you to include single products, variable, grouped and virtual products in the cart without required to reload the entire site each time.

== Speed checkout process ==

WooCommerce Direct Checkout aims to simplify the checkout process, leading to an immediate increase in sales. This plugin for WooCommerce allows you to redirect users to the checkout instead of cart page, change the text and link of the added to cart alert and include the ajax add to cart button in the products pages.

The checkout options allow you to easily remove the unnecessary fields to reduce the user spend completing those fields. Also WooCommerce Direct Checkot allows you to remove other unnecessary things in the checkout process like the order comments, shipping address, coupon form, policy text, and terms and conditions.

== One page checkout ==
